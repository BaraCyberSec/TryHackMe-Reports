# TryHackMe Reports — BaraCyberSec

This repository documents my daily journey in **cybersecurity** and **SOC analysis** using TryHackMe.  
My goal is to build strong foundations (Networking, Linux/Windows, OSI, TCP/IP), practice **Blue Team** skills (log analysis, SIEM, incident response), and create a visible portfolio for future employers.
